# The following code sets up an agent class using the init method and defines x and y variables.

# changed for all of the agents.
# Created a link to get the list of agents into each of the agents

# executes, if the condition in the if statement is not met.

# If the store of each agent is less than 50, this code will generate a random floating number between 0 and 1 using the random.random() 
# function from the random module. The code should random walk the coordinates 1 step depending on which conditions are met; 
# if random.random() is less than 0.5 self.x/self.y coordinates will increase by 1 and if random.random() is greater than 0.5
# self.x/self.y coordiantes will decrease by 1. 

# To deal with boundary issues, a common solution is to allow points leaving the top of an area to come in at the bottom and leaving 
# left, come in on the right (making the space into a Torus). The following code uses the modulus operator (%) which gives and 
# plots the remainder of a division, to ensure agents don't go missing.
